#
# ANDROID_SDK  The path where the Android SDK is placed on your system.
#
# TARGET       The Android target. For a complete list, type Makefile targets.
#
# DEVICE       The device where you want to run your app on.

#
# upload       Uploads the last built target to an attached Android device.
#
# sign         Generate a signed package.
